'''8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
Your function should work for a call like this one: car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True) 
Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. '''
